🚀 A Python-based framework for **stock price prediction, strategy backtesting, and machine learning-driven trading**.  
This project combines **technical analysis + ML models** to generate **BUY/SELL signals** with backtested results.

## 🔧 Tools & Technologies Used  

- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍  
- **Data Analysis:** Pandas, NumPy  
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn (Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, etc.)  
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Data Source:** Yahoo Finance API (`yfinance`)  
- **Backtesting:** Custom backtest engine for MA crossover & ML strategies

## ⚙️ Process Workflow  

The project follows this step-by-step workflow:  

1. **Data Collection** 📥  
   - Stock data is fetched automatically from **Yahoo Finance** using `yfinance`.  
   - Data includes **Open, High, Low, Close, Volume (OHLCV)**.  

2. **Data Preprocessing & Feature Engineering** 🛠️  
   - Missing values handled, data cleaned.  
   - Technical indicators calculated:  
     - **SMA (Simple Moving Average)**  
     - **EMA (Exponential Moving Average)**  
     - **RSI (Relative Strength Index)**  
     - **MACD (Moving Average Convergence Divergence)**  
     - **Bollinger Bands**  
   - Features standardized for ML models.  

3. **Strategy Selection** 🎯  
   - **Option A → Moving Average Crossover Strategy**  
     - Generates **BUY** when short MA > long MA.  
     - Generates **SELL** when short MA < long MA.  
   - **Option B → Machine Learning Model**  
     - Trains ML classifier (Logistic Regression / Random Forest / SVM).  
     - Predicts next-day trend (Up/Down).  

4. **Backtesting Engine** 📊  
   - Historical trades are simulated.  
   - Portfolio value, PnL (Profit & Loss), and accuracy are calculated.  
   - Equity curve generated.  

5. **Results & Visualization** 📈  
   - Buy/Sell points plotted on stock chart.  
   - Equity curve compared with baseline (Buy & Hold).  
   - Performance metrics exported:  
     - Total Return  
     - Sharpe Ratio  
     - Win Rate  
     - Max Drawdown
